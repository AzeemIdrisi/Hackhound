# NEF (Nationalised Eligibility Framework)

* Fairness: This project promotes a more equitable selection process by ensuring all applicants are evaluated on a level playing field.
* Transparency: A standardized evaluation system fosters transparency and increases trust in the recruitment process.
* Meritocracy: The project emphasizes meritocracy by selecting candidates based on their actual knowledge and skills rather than the grading practices of their specific state board.

## Project Features: Addressing Disparity in GDS Recruitment
This project tackles the unfairness caused by varying state board marking schemes in Gramin Dak Seva (GDS) recruitment for 10th-grade applicants. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities by stage:

## Stage 1: State Board Normalization
* State Board Recognition: The system identifies the state board from which the applicant graduated.
* Criteria Mapping: Maps the applicant's state board to its corresponding standardized criteria. This could involve factors like average difficulty level or historical score distributions for different boards
* Adjusted Scores: Based on the mapped criteria, the system adjusts the applicant's raw marks to reflect a national benchmark.

## Stage 2: Internal Marks Removal
* Internal Assessment Elimination: The system removes any internal marks or grades awarded within a school or district. This ensures external factors like school reputation don't influence eligibility.
* Focus on Standardized Exams: The evaluation solely focuses on scores from standardized external exams conducted by the state board.

## Stage 3: Standardized Marks Formulation
* Score Normalization (Optional): This stage might utilize statistical methods to normalize scores across different state boards, accounting for varying difficulty levels.
* Percentile Ranking (Optional): Alternatively, the system could consider percentiles within each state board. This indicates an applicant's relative position within their state, reducing the influence of absolute marks.
* Minimum Eligibility Threshold: A minimum qualifying score based on a national curriculum for the 10th grade could be established. This ensures a baseline level of competency regardless of the state board.
* Standardized Score Generation: The system generates a final standardized score based on the chosen method (normalized score or percentile) or directly uses the minimum eligibility threshold if no normalization is applied.
